              <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
              <p>Monkeys live all over the world and come in various shapes, sizes and colors. As one of our closest relatives, these mammals are very intelligent and have opposable thumbs, allowing them to use tools and play games.

</p>
              <p>There are more than 260 different types of monkeys. They are separated into two major categories: New World and Old World. The New World monkeys live in the Americas, while Old World monkeys live in Asia and Africa. One difference between the two categories is that Old World monkeys don't have prehensile tails; New World monkeys do. Old World monkeys have special pouches in their cheek where they can store food. Old World monkeys have rump pads, but New World monkeys do not. Also, Old World monkeys' nostrils are small and curved and set close together; most New World monkeys have round nostrils set far apart. </p>
            <p>Many people think that monkeys just eat bananas, but that isn't true. Monkeys are omnivores. This means that they eat meat and plant-based foods. Most monkeys eat nuts, fruits, seeds and flowers. Some monkeys also eat meat in the form of bird's eggs, small lizards, insects and spiders.
</p>
              <p>The bright blue and red colors on a mandrill's face get brighter when they are excited. They also have pouches in their cheeks where they store food for snacks.

When a troop of howler monkeys yell, they can be heard for up to three miles.

Grinning or pulling the lip is a sign of aggression in monkeys, along with yawning, head bobbing, and jerking the head and shoulders forward.</p>
              <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM

              <p>You will find the Monkeys east of the Monkey Trail.</p>
