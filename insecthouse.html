              <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
              <p>An insect hotel, also known as a bug hotel or insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for insects. They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to. Most consist of several different sections that provide insects with nesting facilities â€“ particularly during winter, offering shelter or refuge for many types of insects. Their purposes include hosting pollinators.</p>
              <p>Many insect hotels are used as nest sites by insects including solitary bees and solitary wasps. These insects drag prey to the nest where an egg is deposited. Other insects hotels are specifically designed to allow the insects to hibernate, notable examples include ladybirds (ladybugs) and, arguably, butterflies. </p>
            <p>Butterflies that hibernate like to find sheltered places such as crevices in houses and sheds, or enclosed spaces such as those in bundles of leaves. Some insect hotels incorporate special butterfly enclosures with vertical slits that take into account the animals' sensitive wings, however the suitability of these enclosures for butterflies is disputed.</p>
              <p>Solitary bees and solitary wasps do not live within a hive with a queen. There are males and females. A fertilized female makes a nest in wood or stone and bored into the wood in order to construct a nursery.</p>
