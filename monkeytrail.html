              <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
              <p>Tucked away in the hills behind northwestern Kowloon and Sha Tin lies a hidden wealth of picturesque landscapes shrouded in thick jungle, interspersed with azure lakes. Named after its populations of wild monkeys.</p>
              <p>Once you arrive, you will soon be confronted by many monkeys, invariably a troop of Rhesus Macaques. There are signs at the zoo entrance spelling out the dos and don’ts in regards to the monkeys. From experience, be relaxed. You’re not supposed to feed the animals, but some people do. As a result, the monkeys will approach you if you have food. Just don’t approach them with food and they will mind their own monkey business. Direct eye contact and sudden movements won’t endear you to them. With that out of the way, the monkeys are great fun to watch and can be extremely photogenic </p>
            
              <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND IT
</strong></p>
              <p>You will find the Monkey trail right beside the Monkeys.</p>
