              <h3>RESTAURANT</h3>
              <p>The refurbished outdoor restaurant overlooking the zoo, now offers diners a newly renovated environment and an expanded menu designed to appeal to all tastes, with over 50 food dishes to choose from.</p>
              <p>For starters there is a daily choice of two soups of the day.  These will be served with a Baker’s Basket of fresh breads and rolls which the old kitchen previously lacked the capacity to bake in-house. Or opt for a selection of daily cold starters, and a choice of six crisp mixed salads from the Salad Bar.  Unlike the old salad bar, the new one also offers an option to ‘build your own salad’.  And for the diet conscious healthier options of salad dressings will now be available.</p>
            <p>For meat lovers the popular daily Carvery will continue to offer a choice of two succulent roasts each day, all served with traditional accompaniments. At the Stir Fry Station, the chef will fry up your selection of vegetables with beef, chicken or calamari, and for the health conscious there is the grill with an offering of chicken, beef and fish. All of this is served with a daily choice of eight garden fresh vegetable dishes.
 </p>
              <p>The dessert bar remains, as always, the piece de resistance where diners can indulge their sweet tooth with an array of decadent desserts, from rich cakes to warm puddings, a selection of individual deserts and custards and three flavours of ice-creams.  Also an option is a cheese platter spread with biscuits.

The restaurant is a non-smoking facility for the whole family and whatever your fancy, there is a dish to tantalise your tastebuds.Some of the menu favourites include a vegetable tandoori wrap with spicy coconut milk or the deep-friend potato bake with mushrooms, peas, cream, chives and cheese. There are also Moroccan-spiced chicken and beef wraps, curries and more. The focus is on sharing good food with great friends.</p>
