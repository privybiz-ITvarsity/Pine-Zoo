              <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
              <p>The giraffe is an African even-toed ungulates and the world’s tallest living terrestrial animal. Some other even-toed ungulates include, hippopotamuses, deer, goats, camels, cattle, antelopes and sheep.</p>
              <p>The giraffe is the tallest mammal in the world, standing at around 4-5m high, and the tallest giraffes ever recorded have been up to 5.9m. That’s over a meter higher than a double-decker bus. It shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that such a large animal weighs quite a lot as well – up to 1900kg, which is more than most cars! </p>
            <p>Giraffes mostly eat fresh leaves and twigs from the tops of trees (particularly spiky acacia trees) where other browsing species can’t reach them. That means giraffes can afford to be pickier than most big animals, and they’re also better able to cope with droughts than smaller animals, as the tallest trees tend to have the deepest roots that reach down to water that other trees can’t access.</p>
              <p>Giraffes occasionally sit or lie down, but not for long. They do most things standing up, including sleeping, mating and giving birth. After a gestation lasting around 450 days, one of the longest of any hoofed animal, a female giraffe drops her calf – literally. The 100kg baby falls around 2m to the ground, snapping its umbilical cord</p>
              <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM
</strong></p>
              <p>You will find the Giraffes at the back of the zoo.</p>
